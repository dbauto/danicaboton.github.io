This makes it difficult to compare planned and actual effort, prevent overlapping time entries, distinguish rework, and determine which approved hours should feed employee compensation.',
      solution:'I designed a Google Workspace operating system where Google Sheets acts as the structured operational datastore, Google Apps Script enforces task and timekeeping rules, and a role-based member interface converts Start, Pause, Resume, Complete, and Revision actions into append-only work sessions. Approved work logs drive project progress, planned-versus-actual effort, resource utilization, rework analysis, timesheet approval, payable-hour calculations, project labor costs, and labor-budget variance.',

      problem:'Project tracking alone does not provide reliable evidence of who worked when, which effort was original versus rework, which hours were approved, which historical labor rate applied, or how approved cost should be allocated back to a project and task. The system therefore needed both a usable Monday.com workspace and an auditable data model underneath it.',
      solution:'I structured an isolated Monday.com operating system around eight connected data boards. Projects and Tasks remain the operational interface; Work Sessions are the append-only source of actual time; Revisions preserve rework context; Timesheets represent approval state; Labor Rates are effective-dated; an Approved Work Ledger freezes approved project/task/hour/rate/cost allocations; and Activity & Automation Logs preserve technical and business history.

The public reconstruction uses synthetic people and values and does not expose the original client workspace.',
