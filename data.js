    problem: 'Recruitment information and activity were fragmented across separate applicant, job-opening, facility, follow-up, and reporting processes. This created duplicated work, manual coordination, inconsistent stage and activity history, and limited visibility into each applicant’s full recruitment lifecycle. Recruiters spent too much time reconciling records and tracking updates instead of candidate engagement and decision-making, while past applicants were difficult to rediscover for future openings.',
    solution: 'I designed a centralized recruitment operating platform in Zoho CRM. Applicants, Employees, Job Openings, Facilities, Workqueue, Tasks, Meetings, Calls, reports, and analytics are connected through Zoho CRM modules and relationships. Workflow rules trigger Deluge functions that manage record updates, recruitment history, assignments, reporting, validation, and other operational actions inside Zoho CRM. n8n is deliberately isolated to resume processing: it receives an applicant record reference, extracts the resume, compares it with job requirements through structured AI analysis, validates the output, and writes the result back to the Zoho CRM applicant record. No other recruitment automation is delegated to n8n.',
